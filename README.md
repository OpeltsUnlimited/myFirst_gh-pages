### notes: Switching to Stats:

* State allows to react to a change of value
* usage needs some change to how the program works:

* "taskListData" is initialized using the load function
* a "useEffect" reactrs to changes in "taskListData"
  and clears&rebuilds the task list.
* add/remove function now just use "setTaskListData" to change
